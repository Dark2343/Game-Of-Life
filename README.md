# Game-Of-Life
Developed a Game of Life simulation program using C++ to demonstrate cellular automata principles. Implemented various algorithms for grid initialization, cell evolution, and visualization, resulting in a visually appealing and interactive simulation

To change the grid just change the 'N' or 'K' in the header file, then run the game from the Game.cpp file
