# Game-Of-Life 
The Game's rules are as follows:
1- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
These rules are applied to each cell in the grid simultaneously, resulting in the emergence of complex and often unpredictable patterns.

To control the grid just change the 'N' or 'K' in the header file, then run the game from the Game.cpp file
