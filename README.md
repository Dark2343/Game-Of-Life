# Game-Of-Life 
<h3>The Game's rules are as follows:</h3>
1- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.<br>
2- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.<br>
3- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
4- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br><br>
These rules are applied to each cell in the grid simultaneously, resulting in the emergence of complex and often unpredictable patterns.<br><br>

To control the grid change the 'N' or 'K' defined at top in the header file, then run the game from the Game.cpp file.
